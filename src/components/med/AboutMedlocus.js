                <p>After we finish our high school, in science some of us may be wondering what may be the best option for ourselves, especially with biology as major, and some may be determined with what we want. There are some who may be using hit and trial either being perfect in every field or being confused about what may be the best. There is no best or the worst. Only thing that matters is our perception towards any field. After all, every profession has its own dignity. For those who are determined, give your best to what you want. Always think, the sky is the limit. There is nothing impossible for you, though it may be difficult. No one is born perfect. There is nothing like 'born with talent'. All of us started this journey of life with the same cry. We might be different today, but all of that is because of our hard work. We have to love what we do, we have to put all of our efforts into that, that's what make difference.
                    We are never late for a fresh beginning. During the course of preparation there are days when we are really overwhelmed, there are days when we are tired of reading, there are days we beat up ourselves, there are days when we ask if what we want is worth it,  there are days when we score lesser than we deserve, there are days when we loose all the hopes of seeing our name in the scholars list, there are days we feel like sleeping for the whole day, there are times we feel burn out, there are days we can't hold our tears back, etc and etc. But, keep calm, held your head high and just push yourself a little, give yourself a thrust, feel proud for where you are now, motivate yourself, close your eyes and think why you wanted what you want, there is always light at the other end of the tunnel, every night is followed by a beautiful sunshine, take rest, practise breathing, keep your mind fresh, keep talking to your loved ones, work for your mental health as well, but make yourself believe that there is no going back. It is a very long journey and preparation; literally means making yourself worthy for what you want, it's just the baby step. There are so many obstacles coming up next. You are preparing yourselves for your future endeavours. A beautiful morning will come to your life as well. Don't underestimate yourself. Respect what you have learnt till the date. Always stay curious. Be a passionate and enthusiastic learner. Be open to learn new things. Analyse things you learn. Don't just study, make the habit of learning. Enjoy practising questions. Solve as many questions as you can. Make concepts through questions and vice-versa. Revision is the key to keeping you motivated. Your marks may be constant sometimes, in model exams, apply new techniques of reading. Revision is the key to increase marks. The more you revise, the more you become confident in anything you have read.
                    Trust me, everything you go through during this phase is worth it. Just make sure if you fall for seven times, stand up eight. Sometimes, you may rest for a moment and decide if falling down is working for you, and get a healthier plan. Don't stop working for what keeps you alive; your passion for your aim.
                    Remember ! Not practice, but perfect practice makes a man perfect. Work like a horse not like an ass; Be smart and stay passionate. Think:  how badly you want what you, get out of your comfort zone and try new approach to things. You are just a 200 questions' entrance exam away from what you have wanted for your whole life. Ask yourself everyday, why you have to be the one, who gets the scholarship. Find answer for yourself. Work your best till you get your name in that list. Don't set limits for yourself. Go and get it!!
                    Happy preparation!
